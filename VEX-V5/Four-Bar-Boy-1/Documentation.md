Clippy was built with the intention of been able to keep mobile goals and secure them. It is able to grab on to two bases from both the back and the front. With the front having the purpose of adding bases to the tipping point. The back had the role of holding the mobile bases. The robot was built with the idea of grabbing bases and securing them, being able to play both offensively and defensively.
